Learning Objectives
-------------------

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/mGnreK2ar-4GUXzcb9OtXw "explain to anyone"), **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
-   What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
-   What the the relational operators and how to use them
-   What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
-   What are the boolean operators and how to use them
-   How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
-   How to use comments
-   How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
-   How to assign values to variables
-   How to print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int` with `printf`
-   How to use the `while` loop
-   How to use variables with the `while` loop
-   How to print variables using `printf`
-   What is the `ASCII` character set
-   What are the purpose of the `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`

Requirements
------------

### General

-   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project
-   There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
-   You are not allowed to use `system`
-   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl "betty-style.pl") and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl "betty-doc.pl")
